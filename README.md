## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Writing clean and semantic HTML structure
- Creating responsive designs using media queries
- Managing layout with Flexbox and ensuring visual balance

### Continued development

I would like to explore:

- Improving accessibility by using aria labels and semantic roles
- Transitioning to CSS Grid for more complex layouts
- Adding dark mode toggle using JavaScript
- Using design tokens or a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS
